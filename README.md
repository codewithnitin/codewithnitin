Mantras :

1. Always try to brush up yourself with new learning.
2. Be a person who delivers his knowledge to the others to improve themselves as that would be good for them as well as your revision.
3. If problem occurs so be calm and focus to resolve it instead of blaming.
4. We programmer always sit on the chair so to keep ourself healthy we must indulge with some physical activites just like my healthy programmer
exercise which is a part of python-course repository so if we are in office we can create it and run into the cmd while working.
